Starter repository for the film and tv challenge based on a fictitious startup as part of the Codurance AI Hackathon

# StreamStack

## Context
StreamStack is a new startup aiming to build a **community-driven platform** where users can review and rate Netflix shows and films.

They believe that while Netflix offers a vast catalogue of content, it lacks a **social layer** for discussion, recommendations, and authentic viewer feedback.

The first version of the platform will be a **simple web application** allowing users to:
- Browse Netflix titles
- View detailed information
- Leave ratings and written reviews

StreamStack is open to using any technology or framework (React, Vue, Angular, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, etc.).  
The only restriction: **no low-code or no-code tools** are allowed.

The **UI/UX is completely up to you**.  
They encourage creativity and want an intuitive, visually engaging interface that would appeal to TV and film enthusiasts.

To get started, StreamStack recommends using this open-source Netflix titles dataset from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Netflix Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data)
